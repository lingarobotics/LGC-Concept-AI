## Learn Mode — Exam-Oriented Explanation

---

### 1. Purpose

Learn Mode is designed to help students produce **accurate, structured, and examination-ready answers** aligned with **Anna University examination standards**.

Its objective is not merely conceptual explanation, but precise alignment with how marks are awarded in written examinations.

In addition to structured explanations, Learn Mode includes a **Core Point Extraction mechanism** to identify distinct scoring units within each answer.

### 2. Functional Capabilities

Learn Mode performs the following:

- Identifies the **exact aspect(s)** of the question  
  (e.g., definition, construction, working, comparison, application).

- Responds strictly within the **explicit scope of the question**, avoiding omissions or unnecessary additions.

- Structures answers using **clear headings and logically ordered bullet points** suitable for exam evaluation.

- Maintains appropriate **depth, clarity, and length**, particularly for standard **13-mark questions**.

- Includes **one clearly labelled analogy**  
  *(for conceptual understanding only — not intended for direct exam writing).*

- Executes **Core Point Extraction**:
  - After the structured explanation, the system extracts  
    **6–8 distinct core scoring points** (based on question weight).
  - Each core point represents an independent marking unit.
  - This enables:
    - Efficient revision  
    - Completeness verification  
    - Clear understanding of mark distribution

### 3. Deliberate Constraints

Learn Mode intentionally avoids:

- Over-answering beyond the defined scope of the question.

- Mixing unrelated aspects  
  (e.g., including advantages when only working is requested).

- Conversational, informal, or chat-style explanations.

- Evaluation of student understanding  
  *(this function is handled by Teach-Back Mode).*

### 4. Recommended Usage

Learn Mode should be used:

- During examination preparation.

- When studying a topic for the first time.

- When converting conceptual knowledge into exam-ready structure.

- When precision, alignment, and structure directly impact marks.

### 5. Core Principle

> Marks are lost when answers do not align precisely with the question.

Learn Mode exists to:

- Eliminate scope mismatch  
- Ensure structural accuracy  
- Align responses with marking schemes  
- Decompose explanations into measurable scoring units  

It ensures that students not only understand a concept, but can present it in a format that maximizes scoring potential.
