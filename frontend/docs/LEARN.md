# Learn Mode — Exam-Oriented Explanation

## 1. Purpose

Learn Mode exists to help students produce **correct, structured, and exam-ready answers** aligned with **Anna University examination standards**.  
It focuses on answering questions in the exact way marks are awarded, not just explaining concepts.

## 2. What This Mode Does

Learn Mode:

- Identifies the **exact aspect(s)** of the question  
  (definition, construction, working, comparison, application, etc.).

- Answers **only what is explicitly asked**, ensuring no extra or missing content.

- Uses **clear headings and structured bullet points** suitable for exam evaluation.

- Maintains **appropriate depth and length**, especially for standard **13-mark questions**.

- Includes **one clearly labelled analogy**  
  *(for understanding only — not to be written in the exam)*.

## 3. What This Mode Avoids

Learn Mode deliberately avoids:

- Over-answering beyond the scope of the question.

- Mixing unrelated aspects  
  (for example, adding advantages when only working is asked).

- Chat-style, conversational, or informal explanations.

- Evaluating or judging the student’s understanding  
  *(this is handled by Teach-Back Mode)*.

## 4. When to Use Learn Mode

Use Learn Mode:

- Before examinations.

- When learning a topic **for the first time**.

- When converting conceptual understanding into **exam-ready answers**.

- When accuracy, structure, and depth directly affect marks.

## 5. Core Principle

> Marks are lost when answers do not match the question.

Learn Mode exists to **prevent scope mismatch and structural errors**, ensuring answers align precisely with **exam expectations and marking schemes**.
