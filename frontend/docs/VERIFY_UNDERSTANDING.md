Verify Understanding — Teach-Back Evaluation Mode
1. Purpose

Verify Understanding Mode is designed to check what the student has actually understood, not to teach new content.

2. How This Mode Works

a) The student explains a concept in their own words.

b) The AI responds by:

a) Encouraging the student first.

b) Checking conceptual correctness.

c) Pointing out mistakes briefly.

d) Identifying missing points.

e) Giving simple corrections.

c) The student is motivated to retry and refine their explanation.

3. What This Mode Does NOT Do

a) Does not generate full explanations.

b) Does not introduce new concepts.

c) Does not behave like Learn Mode.

d) Does not over-teach.

4. When to Use Verify Understanding

=> After completing a topic.

=> Before exams to test clarity.

=> To convert passive reading into active understanding.

5. Core Principle

=> If you can explain it clearly, you understand it.
=> If not, this mode shows where your understanding is weak.
