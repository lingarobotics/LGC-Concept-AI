# Teach-Back Mode — Verify Understanding

## 1. Purpose

Teach-Back Mode is designed to **verify what the student has actually understood**, not to teach new content.  
It focuses on checking clarity, correctness, and completeness of the student’s own explanation.

## 2. How This Mode Works

Teach-Back Mode follows a simple evaluation loop:

- The student explains a concept **in their own words**.

- The system responds by:
  - Encouraging the student first.
  - Checking **conceptual correctness**.
  - Pointing out mistakes **briefly and clearly**.
  - Identifying **missing or weak points**.
  - Providing **simple corrective guidance**, without re-teaching.

- The student is then motivated to **retry and refine** their explanation.

## 3. What This Mode Does Not Do

Teach-Back Mode deliberately does not:

- Generate full explanations or detailed theory.

- Introduce new concepts that were not mentioned by the student.

- Behave like Learn Mode or provide exam-structured answers.

- Over-teach or replace active learning.

## 4. When to Use Teach-Back Mode

Use Teach-Back Mode:

- After completing a topic.

- Before examinations to test conceptual clarity.

- To convert **passive reading into active understanding**.

## 5. Core Principle

> If you can explain it clearly, you understand it.

Teach-Back Mode exists to **expose gaps in understanding**, so they can be corrected before they affect learning or exam performance.
