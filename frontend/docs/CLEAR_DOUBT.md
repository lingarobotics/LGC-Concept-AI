- Identifies and corrects **wrong assumptions immediately**.

- Processes each question independently, without relying on prior context.

- Uses a **clear and supportive tone**, not exam-oriented language.

## 3. What This Mode Avoids

Doubt Mode deliberately avoids:

- Full explanations or long theoretical discussions.

- Exam-style structuring, headings, or mark-oriented formatting.

- Re-teaching the entire topic from scratch.

- Introducing unrelated or additional information.

## 4. When to Use Doubt Mode

Use Doubt Mode:

- When you already know the topic but feel **confused about one point**.
